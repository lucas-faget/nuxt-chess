A pawn may move by vertically advancing to a vacant square ahead. The first time a pawn moves, it has the additional option of vertically advancing two squares, provided that both squares are vacant. A pawn captures by moving diagonally forward one square to the left or right.",

If a player's king is threatened with capture, it is said to be in check, and the player must remove the threat of capture on their next move. If this cannot be done, the king is said to be in checkmate, resulting in a loss for that player. A player cannot make any move that places their own king in check.",
